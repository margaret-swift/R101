________________________________________________________________________________

Welcome to ENV 710! I'm one of your TA's, Maggie, and I'm 
going to be going through some of the basics of programming and R so that you
all are ready when the class starts up.

The focus of this module is to introduce all of you to R and RStudio, so you 
can get a feel for what R is and how to use it. If you already have RStudio
downloaded and ready to go, you can skip on down to Part 2: All Those Windows.

Programming terms introduced in this section: **R, RStudio, programming language, GUI, open-source language, return, assigning a variable, script, echo**.

## PART 1: Downloading R and RStudio
*This section will get you started with R and RStudio. By the end, you should
have both downloaded and able to run on the computer you're using for this
class.*

One of the most frequent questions I get for this section is "What's the difference
 between R and RStudio? Do I have to have both?" Yes, you do have to have both. 
 **R** is a **programming language**, which means that it tells your computer what to do.
 R is like the words in a book: the information stored inside is what tells your brain
 what's going on. **RStudio** is an interface, often called a **GUI** for "Graphical User
 Interface" (said like "gooey"). RStudio is just a nice wrapper for R so that you can program with less
 stress. Think of RStudio as the cover, pages, pictures, and glossary in a book; you don't need
 these things to read a novel, but it's definitely a lot easier than reading one long
 line of text.
 
 So, for this class, we need both the novel (R) and all the [fixins](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-the-phrase-with-all-the-fixins) that make it easy to read (RStudio).

### The Novel: Steps to download and install R

1. Click this link <http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/> to access the R download page. This is hosted on a website called CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network), and you'll be using it a lot with R.
2. Click the appropriate link for your operating system in the "Download and Install R" section.
3. Next, click the link labeled something like "R-x.x.x.pkg (notarized and signed)". This will start the download of the latest version of R. At the time of this writing, the latest should be "R-4.0.2.pkg", but it's updated regularly.
4. Once your download is finished, find it in your "Downloads" folder and double-click to open. Follow the instructions on the installer (accepting all the defaults).
5. You have now installed R! Congrats!

### The Fixins: Steps to download and install RStudio

1. Click this link <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> to access the RStudio download page.
2. Click the appropriate link for your operating system in the "Download and Install R" section. You can skip Step 1 because you already have R installed.
3. Once your download is finished, find it in your "Downloads" folder and double-click to open. Follow the instructions on the installer (accepting all the defaults).
5. You have now installed RStudio! Congrats!


## PART 2: All Those Windows
*This section will orient you to All Those Windows that you see when you first
open RStudio. There are a lot of things going on, but I promise that it'll get
less overwhelming once we go over their uses and functions!*

Before we get started, find the place where you installed RStudio (likely in your Applications folder)
 and double-click to open it. If you have any errors or problems so far, STOP and email me (mes114@duke.edu)
 with your question and a copy-paste or screenshot of the issue.
 
When you open RStudio for the first time, you should see four window panes inside
 the application. You can choose to change the orientation of the panes (and things like
 the background and font size/color) from the Preferences menu, but for now, we'll deal 
 with the panes as they are "out of the box".
 
### Pane 1: Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer
This pane is going to be your best friend. Here you can see any plots you've made, view
where your files and packages are, and most importantly, use the Help menu. 


*Files:* This is just like your Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows). You can open files from here.

*Plots:* This will be empty right now, but this's where your graphs and figures will show up.

*Packages:* We will cover packages later; R is called an **open-source language**, which means that users can create free content for anyone else to use. Try clicking on the check boxes to load different packages (you won't see much happen).

*Help:* Use the Help menu when you don't know what something does. For example, type `sum` into the search bar. A document should show up describing the `sum()` function in R. A lot of this
might be nonsense to you now, but this will be helpful in the future. 

*Viewer:* This lets you look at web content; you won't need it right now.

### Pane 2: The Console
All right, now we're at the console! You might also see tabs labeled Terminal, R Markdown, and Jobs, but just ignore those for now.

The console is your main interface to R. Anything you type in there, the console will tell R to do it. The most basic thing we can do with R is to use it as a calculator. Try typing `5 + 6`, then press enter. There will be two numbers that R **returns** to you: `[1]` and `11`. If `11` is our answer, then what is the `[1]` for? This is R's way of telling us that `11` is the first thing it's returning. Snice there's only one thing, it's kind of redundant for now; later on, though, we will deal with things like lists and data frames that might deal with more than one item; it's helpful to know 

Remember that `sum()` function we looked up earler? Try typing `sum(5, 6)` into the console. Press enter to see the results--is it what you expected?

### Pane 3: Environment and History

*Environment:* Some people use this tab a lot, others not so much. It's really up to you. I like it because I can see everything that I've saved so far, in the state that I saved it. You probably don't have anything in here yet, so head back to the console and type `a <- 3`. This is called **assigning a variable**; you're telling R that you want the **variable** `a` to hold the **value** `3`, by linking them with the little left-arrow `<-`. The arrow is unique to R, and most other programming languages just use a `=` instead. It's fine if you want to do it this way. One of the fun things about R is that there are many ways to accomplish the same task, and there is rarely one 'right' way to do things. You can come up with your own personal style.

You should see something change in the Environment now---a little chart that tells you that `a` equals `3`. We'll talk in the next section about this in more detail, but you can see if you've got a lot of variables floating around, how nice it is to have a list of all of them.

*History:* Exactly what it sounds like. Click this tab and you'll see everything you've typed in so far this session.

### Pane 4: Scripts
By this point you may have realized that you don't have a 4th pane. If not, no worries; the last pane is to hold your **scripts**, which are like a list of instructions for R to carry out. Instead of typing in things like `5 + 6` and `a <- 3` every time you open up RStudio, you can save your work. To create a new script, go to the very top left corner of your screen and click the white box with a green plus on it, then select "R Script". Or, try Shift+ctrl+N for a shortcut. Either way, a new script should appear in the fourth pane.

Scripts work just the same as your console, but (1) you can save your work, and (2) you can run many lines at once. Try typing this into your script: `a <- 8`, then press enter, then type `a + 3` in the next line. Each command in a script in R must be on a separate line. 

Now, there are a couple of ways to get what you just typed over to the console. You could copy and paste it over, but that would be silly. Instead, highlight the two lines you just typed, then click the green right-arrow that says "Run" on the top of your scripts section. You should see both lines **echoed** over in the console now, with the answer as well.

Anything you highlight will run in order. If you don't highlight anything, what happens?



________________________________________________________________________________
And now we're done! You should now be familiar with all the windows and panes in RStudio. Try going to your settings to customize how you want your RStudio to look. You'll be using this a lot, so it's worth your time. For me, I have my scripts in top left, console top right, environment bottom left, and plots/help bottom right.

When you're ready, move on to the next: "Just the Basics", in a file called "02_JustTheBasics".
